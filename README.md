# FIFA World Cup
The __*FIFA World Cup*__ is a global football competition contested by the various
football-playing _nations of the world_. It is contested every four years and is the
most prestigious and important trophy in the sport of football.
This project is a simple slicing and filtering of the FIFA world cup dataset and
I might come up with __jupyter notebook__ of this same project for the purpose of
data visualization anytime soon.

The project has the purpose for asking the user to chose **the year** and **the competition stage**
they may want to analyze or can chose to analyze all the competition and/or all the stages.
- **Years**: `1930, 1934, 1938, 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982,
1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014`;

- **Stages**: ``'Group A', 'Group B', 'Group C', 'Group D', 'Group E', 'Group F', 'Group G',
'Group H', 'Preliminary round', 'First round', 'Round 16', 'Quarter-finals', 'Semi-finals',
'Play-off for third place', 'Final'``.

## Dataset
The World Cups dataset show all information about all the World Cups in the history
__*from 1930 to 2014*__, while the World Cup Matches dataset shows all the results from the matches contested as part of the cups.
The dataset is in __csv__ format as `WordCupMatches.csv`

## Software needed
The following open source software are required to work on this project:

- You need to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- A text editor eg.([VsCode]('https://code.visualstudio.com/'), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/))
- A terminal (in my case, I use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

## Acknowledgement
I am able to do this python data analysis thanks to the knowledge from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).
And I usually get datasets like this _FIFA World Cup_ from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/])
